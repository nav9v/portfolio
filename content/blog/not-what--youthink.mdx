## DevOps and Deployment

### Containerization with Docker

Docker has become essential for modern deployments:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Cloud Platforms

Popular deployment platforms include:

- **Vercel** - Perfect for Next.js apps
- **Netlify** - Great for JAMstack sites
- **AWS** - Enterprise-grade solutions
- **Google Cloud Platform** - Scalable infrastructure

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Testing individual components and functions:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

test('renders hello world', () => {
  render(<HelloWorld />);
  expect(screen.getByText(/hello world/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
